- discrete circle of q-1 points around the origin
- different color circles for each 1-dim’l subspace (coordinate axes)
- note subspaces also have a zero, which can be omitted, so they are circles of size q'-1, and note q'-1 | q-1 when q = p^r and q' = p^r' and r'|r
- 2-dim’l subspace by shifting a circle by +1 repeatedly in an orthogonal direction
- e.g. in F_{3^4} one could visualize F_{3^2} with 9 points which are three triangles, e.g. the x0x1-plane

tools:
- geometry nodes in blender

future directions:
- promote to 3d visualization using blender
